# Flow of the Project:

    * A user goes to the website and logs in. (optional)
      * cnot to create a auth feature.
    * the user is presented with a blank todo interface (if the user is new then the interface will create a new list for the user.) If not, the user will resume previrews session.
    * If optional step is not implemented them:
      * user goes to the site and interacts with the application.
      * the application has a list of task in which the user can update, delete, create or read.
      * CRUD - create, read, update, delete.
